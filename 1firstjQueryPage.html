    // .document tells we going to do aciton on the page itself.
    // onload fires only after all of the contents (images/files) are loaded, but ready passes much early
    //as soon as the page's Document Object Model (DOM) becomes safe to manipulate.
    //This will often be a good time to perform tasks that are needed before the user views or interacts with the page,
    //for example to add event handlers and initialize plugins. When multiple functions are added via successive calls to this method,
    //they run when the DOM is ready in the order in which they are added. As of jQuery 3.0,
    //jQuery ensures that an exception occuring in one handler does not prevent subsequently added handlers from executing.
